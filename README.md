📖 About the Project

This project was developed as a collaborative effort between Denys Koval and Nikol Voronina.
The goal was to create an engaging web-based escape room experience using only core web technologies — HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — without relying on external frameworks.

Together, we designed interactive puzzles, implemented user progression logic, and crafted a responsive and intuitive interface.

Through this project, we practiced teamwork, creative problem-solving, and real-world web development skills.
